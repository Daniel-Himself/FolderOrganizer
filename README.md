# FolderOrganizer - A beginner level Python script
A small script to organize a folder into subfolders by file types. It is, in fact, my first script in Python.

Created for my personal use and shared for education purposes.


## How to use
1. In the script itself, make sure to change my predefined downloads directory location to your own.

1. Then, create four folders in your Download folder and name them as Downloaded Images, Downloaded Documents, Downloaded Software and Log (It will just contain a single file named log.txt which will be the output of our script).

1. Place the .py in the unorganized directory (Downloads is the one I use)

1. Open the terminal, go to the Download directory and run the following command:
    
    `python3 FolderOrganizer.py >>~/Downloads/Log/log.txt`

The script was largely based on [nitish-dev-1503's version of the script](https://github.com/nitish-dev-1503/Organize-Download-Files), modified a little to suite my personal needs.

Feel free to change it to suit your desired behaviour.
